What to Include in a 5-15 Report
The structure of the report can vary but, in general, it will have the following elements:

Achievements. Detail your team's accomplishments during the period. Include activities members have completed and objectives they've met.
Plans. List the objectives and priorities for your team for the following period. Make these as specific as possible, and set dates for completion.
Potential Challenges. If you think it may be difficult for team members to achieve their goals, explain why.
Opportunities. Describe any lessons you have learned over the relevant period, note any areas where the team can improve, and identify any opportunities that have opened up.
You can tailor your report to your specific needs. Here are some other possible headings:

Suggestions. What problem does your team need to resolve? Are there ways that you can improve how things are done?
People and Morale. How do you feel? How do your team members feel? Be direct in describing the work climate around you.
Risks. Are there any key risks that you've identified? What can you do to mitigate them?
