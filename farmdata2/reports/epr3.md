1. What have we done
- merged the issue # 159.
- issues 200, 202, 203 are currently ready for review.
- When we were working on the issue 202, we found 2 bugs.
    -One of them already has issue tracker but the other one is not. We are currently working on making issue tracker for that.
- Found out that using 'href' is not working.  

2. Challenges
- for issue 202, the edit button did not show up unless the rendered browser had a height or width greater than 900 pixels.
- for issue 202, when the edit button was clicked, the crop dropdown menu had duplicate options which caused errors when running cypress tests as the cypress didn't know which identical item to choose from
- for issue 203, it was difficult to determine which datastore function to use. 

3. What to do
- make issue trackers for issue 202 and 203. 
- Make final presentation 
- send email to Prof. MacCormick about merge request.
